						<h4 class="heading">imagine waking up in dimly lit room..</h4>
						<p>
							imagine waking up in dimly lit room, chained to an aluminum chair pushed closely into place around the edge of a large, round wooden table. as you begin to come to, you look up and see seven other people chained the same way and arranged around the table. they all begin to speak at once, clamoring to be heard over the tsunami of confusion and uncertainty that is uncomfortably building throughout the room. your attention, however, is drawn to a simple timer located at the center of the table, which appears to be counting down seconds until zero. you try to focus the group's attention on the clock, but division dominates and the timer soon reaches single digits. 3...2...1... you watch as the clock flips its final second. before you can process, the chair to your right is wrenched backwards, its passenger--the stranger you never even spoke to--screaming as he is dragged into the darkness of the room, his voice fading into oblivion. the room and table are now silent. you don't know what's back there, but you, and the six remaining strangers, do not want to find out. you look back at the clock. 60...59...58... intrigued?
						<p>
							welcome to circle! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT1LJFP7uJo" target="_blank">*queue music*</a> the app that puts judgements, opinions, and vanity in charge of democracy. though not as dramatic as the scenario above (largely spun off from the 2015 movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_(2015_film)" target+"_blank">circle</a>), the app does provide users with a unique experience and an opportunity to play however they want. each round, which does last just 60 seconds, gives the players a chance to make an impression via text, team-up and form alliances, or lay low and wait it out. by the power of the vote, the group has the ability to decide who will be the first or next to be eliminated. if no one votes, a random user is kicked--an outcome which everyone wants to avoid. the app is mob mentality at its finest. a chance to control the machine and other people. how will the group choose who deserves to get booted? what happens when there's only two people left?
						</p>
						<!-- Copy -->
						<p class="mb-6">
							 the game begins as eight random users are pushed to a group chat. these eight strangers are free to chat with one another via text, view each other's profiles, and make any judgements. as already explained, a minute long timer ticks away, likely motivating players to make an impression quickly. when the minute is up, someone must be kicked from the group, a decision which is made by counting which player got the most votes. the game continues (six rounds) until all but 2 players are eliminated. these two victors are added to each other's friends list and are free to message privately whenever. depending on when a user is eliminated from the group, his or her 'slate' ranking will go up or down (see explanation graphic here). each game round also gives the player the option to use shields, an in-app feature that prevents the player from being eliminated from chat, despite the number of elimination votes they received that round.

							<p>
								 how do i join a game?
							</p>
							<p class="author">pretty simple. just tap the button on the landing screen.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 i'm waiting to join a game but nothing is happening. it just keeps saying 'not enough players ..'
							</p>
							<p class="author">whenever someone clicks the button to join a game they are added to a wait queue (called the lobby). normally the delay between when a user wants to join game and when they are pushed through is less than a second, however, when there are not eight or more players in the lobby queue, game creation won't fire. if you are trying to join a game with users on your campus and you've been waiting a really long time, chances are not enough people at your school use the app yet. go tell ur friends to download the app :)</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 what? i locked my phone while in a group chat and when i unlocked it, i was no longer in the game
							</p>
							<p class="author">circle is all about being present. we wan't to discourage people from joining games and not participating (boosting). if you are in a group chat and you hard close the app or lock your phone, you will be removed from the chat. hiding the app (pressing the home button) is allowed but you can still get kicked from the chat in your absence.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 i randomly get kicked from chat well before the timer runs out, wtf?
							</p>
							<p class="author">this is a side effect of our presence system. if your internet access changes or is interrupted the app will interpret it as if you had locked your phone. we are working to make this more flexible but in the meantime, try to make sure your internet is decent (and <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/" target="_blank">fair</a>).</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 how do i report a message or profile picture?
							</p>
							<p class="author">all you gotta do is press and hold on the offending message or profile picture and follow the on screen prompt. we will review and act on the report with in 24 hours.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 help! this user is making me uncomfortable in private messaging
							</p>
							<p class="author">you can only send or receive messages to/from people that you are friends with. if want someone to stop messaging you, simply unfriend them. if your chat partner is really overstepping some boundaries you also have the option to block the user. blocking the user will not only unfriend them, but will also prevent either you or them from viewing the other's account again and will not let his or her messages appear in chat during group play.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 eww! this user is making everyone uncomfortable in group chat
							</p>
							<p class="author">if a user is rubbing you the wrong way in chat the best option is to work to get him or her kicked asap. however, there is an option to flag the offending messages by pressing and holding the message and following the prompts. we also have a dedicated email address that exists to review and respond to offending users and actions. this can be found at <a href="http://report.competitivechat.com" target="_blank">report.competitivechat.com</a></p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								 i'm in college and i want more people at my school using this, can i become a campus rep?
							</p>
							<p class="author">that would be tight. we will offer more formal programs soon but, in the meantime, <a href="mailto:contact@competitivechat.com">contact us</a> and we can try to work out a contract/payment plan for your time and help</a></p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								i am a venture capatalist or a representative of an accelerator program. i am interested in investing in and/or helping circle?
							</p>
							<p class="author">amazing! cirlce is currently seeking business partners and/or external sources to accelerate it to the virality it deserves.<a href="mailto:contact@competitivechat.com">contact us</a> please.</p>

			<p>submitted to the app store for review but binary was rejected by Apple <em>(guideline 1.2)</em>. New update contains methods for reporting messages and blocking users. also, all image importing (either via camera or gallery) is now checked via google's cloud vision api to prevent dick pics and other inappropriate images from appearing in profile pictures or private messages.</p>

			<p>created eula and app guidelines. added eula clause to login page. added account blocking. this feature can be accessed anytime a user is viewing another user's profile. blocking a user will prevent the blocked user from privately messaging you, viewing your profile, and will prevent the blocked user's messages from appearing on your screen when in a game (group chat). blocked users can be toggled from the settings page. added message reporting. whether in private messaging or in a group chat, a user can now press and hold a text or image they find offensive and flag it for review. the report is saved on our database under the offending user's uid at which point our team will then review/act on the report. added profile image reporting. when viewing another user's profile, users now have the ability to report profile pictures they think violate the app's guidelines. this can be done by pressing and holding the picture they want to report. added profile image screening. using Google's Cloud Vision API, all profile pictures are vetted to check for high probability of either adult content and/or extreme violence. if the picture is of this content, it is not allowed to be uploaded/set as the picture. updated app store screenshots.added gif keyboard to both game chat and private messaging (sourced from giphy) !! :0</p>

			<p>fixed an annoying bug with message and profile reporting. added automatic keyboard close when sticker popover is closed. added bi-daily shield give away function to landing screen. fixed and tested all in-app purchases, they are all now live! added information graphic to group info page to explain how to vote. added a sneaky algorithm to the game creation function which will allow full game creation to occur with only four active players (rather than 8). this temporary module will hopefully mitigate some of the growth lagging that happens when there's not enough users.</p>
